# Covid19 App

It's a simple app to visualize charts and statistics about the current Covid-19 emergency. <br>
It's developed using Flutter and some plugins such as [Circular Charts](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_circular_chart)<br>
All the data visualized in the app is taken from the website [Corona lmao ninja]('https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/all) ðŸ“ˆ<br><br>
